# Challenge 4 - Flashing Lights

Create a flashing light in which all LEDs are switched on and off simultaneously every second. Take a look at the Python program code. Try to assign the lines of code to the respective blocks. Try to change the flashing frequency and the light colors directly in the Python code.


```admonish tip title="Extension 1" collapsible=true
Change the Python code so that only the first half of the LEDs light up.
```
